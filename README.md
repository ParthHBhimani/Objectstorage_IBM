# Objectstorage_IBM
It is a simple project where I have created a bucket in an object storage instance and added an object in it which is basic html file as a part of my final assessment for the course IBM: Introduction to Cloud Computing

I have created a bucket named cloud-object-storage-cos-standard-z22

Next I have uploaded a simple html file as an object to the bucket

Now I have given public access to the object uploaded

This is the screenshot of the file which I have uploaded in the bucket

https://cloud-object-storage-cos-standard-z22.s3.jp-tok.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/index.html

The above url is the html page for the file uploaded

This is the configuration for the bucket whose storage class is smart tier and resiliency is regional

Thank you!
